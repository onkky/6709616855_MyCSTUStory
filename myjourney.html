            <p1>
                Right now I'm so afraid of getting below C in CS101.
                I don't really understand what I had learnt, but I'll try my best
                to pass the CS101 exams. Moreover, I still haven't figured out what
                I want to be in the future. Knowing it faster is better. I want to
                know as many computer language as possible too. I'm trying to understand
                how each code works right now but it may take a while, I had no experience
                at coding before I got into here.
